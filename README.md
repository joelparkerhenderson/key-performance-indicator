## What is a KPI?

A key performance indicator (KPI) is a type of performance measurement.

* A KPI evaluates the success of an organization or activity.

* Choosing the right KPIs needs good understanding of what is important to the organization.

Success examples:

* Repeated periodic achievement of an operational goal, such as 100% customer satistfaction, or zero defects, etc.

* Making progress toward strategic goals.

## How to define a KPI

To define a KPI, you can cover these areas:

* Title: use an exact name to avoid ambiguity

* Objective: the relation of the indicator with the organizational objectives must be clear

* Scope: state the areas of business and/or parts of the organization that are included and/or excluded.

* Target: Benchmarks must be determined in order to monitor progress

* Formula: the exact calculation of the indicator

* Units: what is/are the unit(s) of measurement in use

* Frequency: when is the indicator recorded and reported

* Data source: the exact data sources involved in calculating a indicator value

* Owner: the accountable person for the indicator

* Comments: any outstanding issues regarding the indicator


## How to improve a KPI

To improve a KPI, you can ask these questions:

* Does it clearly define what constitutes success?

* Does it clearly relate to a strategic objective and key result (OKR)?

* Does it provide the information required to set SMART goals?

* Does it accurately portray progress and probability of achieving both long-term strategic objectives and near-term milestones?

* Does it identify the root causes of barriers?

* Does it focus the organization on the priority improvement needs?

* Does it drive the behavior and actions required to achieve the objectives?

* Does it align work with value?


## Indicators

* Quantitative indicators: can be presented with a number.

* Qualitative indicators: can't be presented as a number.

* Leading indicators: predict the outcome of a process

* Lagging indicators: present the success or failure post hoc

* Input indicators: measure the amount of resources consumed during the generation of the outcome

* Process indicators: represent the efficiency or the productivity of the process

* Output indicators: reflect the outcome or results of the process activities

* Practical indicators: interface with existing company processes.

* Directional indicators: specifying how something is changing, such as getting better or worse.

* Actionable indicators: sufficiently in an organization's control to effect change.

* Financial indicators: used in performance measurement and when looking at an operating index.


## Key Leading Indicator (KLI)

A Key Leading Indicator (KLI) is a KPI that tends to show up earliest.


## Key Performance Measure (KPM)

A Key Performance Measure (KPM) is how you measure a KPI.


## Measure vs. metric

There is overlap between a measure and a metric.

* A measure is concrete, usually measure one thing, and are quantitative in nature (e.g. I have five apples).

* A metric describe a quality and require a measurement baseline (I have five more apples than I did yesterday).

Examples:

* A measure can be useful for demonstrating workloads and activity

* A metric can be useful for evaluating compliance, processes effectiveness, and measuring success against established objectives.


## The 7 habits of highly effective KPI users

* <b>KPIs help lead as well as manage.</b> KPIs are more than just “numbers to hit”, they are metrics that help leaders anticipate the future and develop informed business plans.

* <b>KPIs align the organization.</b> Selecting the right KPIs gets everyone in the organization on the same page, with both people and processes aligned to better serve customers’ needs. 

* <b>KPIs provide an integrated view of the customer.</b> Framing KPIs around awareness and anticipation of customer needs enables firms to engage customers at various touchpoints.
    
* <b>KPI components inform decision-making.</b> Organizations with the capability to analyze KPI data in real-time are better positioned to adjust priorities than organizations that can only conduct a retrospective analysis.

* <b>KPI data is shared across business units.</b> Success depends on cross-functional collaboration. Data visibility plays an important part in this collaboration, as managers need to see how their actions impact KPIs.

* <b>KPIs aren’t allowed to proliferate indiscriminately.</b> There is no “magic number” of KPIs, but fewer is generally better: focus on KPIs that drive business growth, such as 3 enterprise KPIs and 3 functional KPIs.

* <b>KPIs serve as data sets for machine learning.</b>  KPIs can “teach” machine learning models in order to improve performance over time. This allows models to input transactional data, then solve for long-term values.
