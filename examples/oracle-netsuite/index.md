## 10 Financial KPIs


### Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit margin measures the amount of money
left over from product sales after subtracting cost
of goods sold (COGS). A higher gross profit margin
indicates the company is efficiently converting its
product or service into profits. COGS is the total
amount to produce a product or service, including
materials and labour. Net sales are revenue minus
returns, discounts, and sales allowances.

Gross profit margin % = 100 * (( Net sales – COGS ) / Net sales)


### Operating Profit Margin

Operating profit margin shows the percentage of
profit a company makes from operations before
accounting for taxes and interest. Increasing operating
margins can indicate better management and cost
controls within a company. To find your operating
profit, subtract COGS, operating expenses, and
depreciation and amortisation from total sales.

Operating profit margin % = 100 * (Operating profit / Revenue)


### Operating Cash Flow

Operating cash flow (OCF) is the amount of cash a
company generates through typical operations. This
metric can give a business a sense of how much cash
it can spend in the immediate future and whether it
should reduce spending. OCF can also reveal issues
like customers taking too long to pay their bills or not
paying them at all. There are two ways to calculate it:
the direct and indirect method.

Operating cash flow (indirect method) = Net income + Depreciation and amortisation – Net working capital

Operating cash flow (direct method) = Cash revenue – Operating expenses paid in cash


### Current Ratio a.k.a. Working Capital Ratio

The current ratio measures the
liquidity of a business to determine if it can meet its
financial obligations. A working capital ratio of 1 or
higher means the business’s assets exceed the value
of its liabilities. Companies often target a ratio of 1.5-2,
and anything below 1 signals future financial problems

Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities


### Quick Ratio a.k.a. Acid Test Ratio

The quick ratio measures
whether a business can fulfil its short-term financial
obligations by evaluating whether it has enough assets
to pay off its current liabilities. Quick ratio is written as
a number, with a ratio of 1.0 meaning a company has
just enough assets to cover its liabilities. Anything
below 1 could mean the company’s business model is
not viable.

Quick ratio = (Cash + Cash equivalents + Marketable securities + Net accounts receivable) / Current liabilities


### Return on Assets (ROA)

Return on assets measures the profitability of a
business compared to its total assets. This return
on investment (ROI) metric shows how effectively a
company uses its assets to generate earnings. A higher
ROA means a business is operating more efficiently. To
calculate average total value of assets, add up all assets
at the end of the current year plus all the assets from
the prior year and divide that by two.

Return on assets = Net income / Average total value of assets


### Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)

The average number of days it takes a company to
make payments to creditors and suppliers is days
payable outstanding. This ratio helps the business see
how well it’s managing cash flow, whether it’s taking
advantage of discounts for early or on-time payments
from vendors, and if it’s a business that will build strong
relationships with suppliers.

Days Payable Outstanding = (Total accounts payable in given period / COGS) x Number of days in period


### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

This metric shows how long it takes, on average, for
customers to pay a company for goods and services.
A higher days sales outstanding indicates a company
takes longer to collect payment, which can lead to cash
flow problems. Generally speaking, the lower your DSO,
the better, but this number usually climbs during times
of economic uncertainty or recessions.

Days sales outstanding = (Total accounts receivable in given period / Total credit sales in period) * Number of days in the period


### Cash Runway and/or Net Burn Rate

Cash runway shows how long a company has before
it runs out of cash based on the money it currently
has available and how much it spends per month.
This metric helps businesses understand when they
need to cut back spending or get additional funding.
If your cash runway shortens over time, it’s a sign your
company is spending more money than it can afford to.

Cash runway = Total capital / Monthly expenses

Burn rate measures how much money a company spends over a
certain period (usually monthly). Burn rate is frequently
used by investor-backed startups that lose money in
their early days.

Net burn rate = (Monthly revenue – COGS) – Monthly expenses


### Budget Variance Rate

Budget variance rate compares a
company’s actual spend or sales in a certain area
against the budgeted amounts. Although budgets are
usually tied to expenses, budget variance can also
compare actual and forecasted revenue. This variance
analysis helps small business leaders identify areas
where they’re overspending that may need further
attention. It also reveals areas of the business
that outperformed expectations and warrant
additional investment.

Budget variance % = 100 * (Actual / Forecast − 1)


## 10 Operational KPIs


### Cost Per Unit

Cost per unit is how much a single unit of product
costs a company to produce or buy. It is best used in
companies that manufacture or sell large amounts of
the same product. Knowing the cost per unit helps
companies understand if they are making products in
a cost-effective manner, how to price products, and
when they’ll turn a profit.

Cost per unit = (Total fixed costs + Total variable costs) / Number of units produced


### Lead Time

Lead time measures the amount of time that passes
between the beginning and end of any supply chain
process. This could be the time between a business
ordering a product from a supplier and receiving it,
between a customer placing an order and receiving it,
or between the start and end of a production process.
In that way, this KPI measures the efficiency of the
entire supply chain or certain steps within it. Lead time
is important because it determines the amount of
inventory a company needs to have on hand to fulfil
orders and therefore impacts stock availability and
customer satisfaction.

Cumulative lead time = Procurement time + Manufacturing time + Shipping time


### Cash Conversion Cycle

This metric tells you the length of time between
when you pay suppliers for materials and when your
customers pay for the final finished product. You want
the cycle time to be as short as possible. Tracking this
metric will help identify potential causes of cash flow
issues. Although this metric varies depending on what
you sell and your customer base, some of the most
efficient companies have cash conversion cycles of
less than one month. However, it can be much longer,
especially if you’re in an industry with long lead times.

Cash conversion cycle = Days sales outstanding + Days of inventory outstanding – Days payable outstanding


### Inventory Turnover Ratio

Inventory turnover ratio is the number of times a
company sells and replaces its stock in a certain time
frame, usually one year. It measures how well a company turns its inventory
into sales. Businesses can use their turnover ratio
to determine if they’re carrying too much inventory
compared to how much of their stock is selling.

Inventory turnover ratio % = 100 * ( COGS / ( Beginning inventory value + Ending inventory value ) / 2 ))


### Sell-Through Rate

Sell-through rate is a comparison of the amount of
inventory sold versus the amount of inventory
produced or received from a supplier. Sell-through
rate is important because it helps you understand
how efficiently you’re selling through inventory. A high
sell-through rate is positive because it means you’re
moving product quickly. A low sell-through rate, on
the other hand, suggests you’re paying to stock
excess inventory.

Sell-through rate % = 100 * (Number of units sold in period / Number of units received in period)


### Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)

The gross margin return on investment measures
how much money a company makes on a specific
inventory investment. Tracking this metric gives
your company insight into which inventory items are
especially strong or weak performers so you can plan
accordingly. In general, a GMROI of 200% or higher is
a good target.

Gross margin return on investment % = 100 * (Gross profit / Average inventory cost)


### Cost of Stockouts

Running out of some goods will be more costly to
your business than others. To measure the impact of
stockouts, you can use the cost of stockouts metric.
Companies can use this to calculate the money lost
when they run too lean or experience an unexpected
surge in demand, leading to stockouts. The cost
of stockouts may also affect the amount of items a
business keeps on hand.

Cost of stockouts = Number of days out of stock * Average units sold per day * Price per unit


### On-Time Delivery Rate

On-time delivery rate measures the percentage of
orders that arrive on time to customers (either on
or before the scheduled delivery date) and analyses
supply chain efficiency. A low rate of on-time delivery
could be a sign of slow processes in your supply chain,
shipping bottlenecks, or slow and unreliable delivery
methods. Regardless, it will hurt customer satisfaction
and could keep the customer from buying from
you again.

On-time delivery rate % = 100 * ((Total orders – Late orders) / Total orders)


### On-Time Shipping Rate

The on-time shipping rate shows how often orders
go out to customers within the promised shipping
window. Tracking this metric is important in assessing
the efficiency of your order fulfilment and shipping
processes. It can also help you pinpoint the proper on-
time delivery benchmarks for various products.

On-time shipping rate % = 100 * (Number of items shipped on time / Total items shipped)


### Perfect Order Rate

Perfect order rate is a measurement of how many
orders a company ships without any issues, such as
damage, inaccuracies, or delays. While every company
aspires to a perfect order rate close to 100%, what’s
realistic for your organisation will vary. This metric is
strongly linked to customer satisfaction and
operational efficiency.

Perfect order rate % = 100 * [(Number of orders delivered on time / Total orders) x (Number of orders complete / Total orders) x (Number of orders damage-free / Total orders) x (Number of orders with accurate documentation / Total orders)]
